# 1. How to use Pear
This tutorial goes through the basic features of pear_ebi and how to use them
_____
## Setup ##
First of all, check that you have a python version that is supported (python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9). We strongly encourage the creation of a dedicated virtual environment in order to avoid potential conflicts with other libraries due to the mismatch of dependencies' versions. We also support the use of mamba as a more efficient version of conda.

<b>In your terminal:</b><br><br>
Download and install mamba: <br>
<a href="https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html">See documentation</a>
<br>Create new environment with one of the supported versions of python:<br>
```mamba create -n pear_env python=3.9```
<br>Activate environment:<br>
```mamba activate pear_ev```
<br>Install pear:<br>
```python -m pip install pear_ebi```

<br><font color='red'><b>Alternatively:</b></font><br>
<br>Install virtualenv:<br>
```pip install virtualenv```
<br>Create new environment with one of the supported versions of python:<br>
```python3.9 -m venv pear_env```
<br>Activate environment:<br>
```source pear_env/bin/activate```
<br>Install pear:<br>
```python -m pip install pear_ebi```

### Optional ###
If you're planning on performing more advanced analyses, such as the ones described in the <b><i>"Advanced Examples"</b></i>, you should install the extended requirements:<br>
```python -m pip intall -r requirements.txt```
<br>and also install the new jupyter kernel:<br>
```python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pear_ebi```
****

## Basic Use ##
After following the steps above to set up pear_ebi, you should be ready to use all the features of pear_ebi!
<br>This notebook is a good guide to learn how to use it and to check that your installation is succesfull. If you should have any problem, please contact us by filing an issue on github.<br>
To start with, simply check your installation by running:


```python
!pear_ebi
```

Pear is complaining because no file was given... since it looks like you don't know how to use it, it kindly suggests to seek help using the `--help` (or simply `-h`) flag. Good idea!

Essentially, pear_ebi does the following:<ul>
    <li>Reads phylogenetic trees in newick format from one or multiple files;
    <li>Computes the distances between the trees with one of the available metrics (refer to `--help` to see them and to the manuscript for their specific functions);
    <li>Embeds the distances in a lower dimensional space. Basic usage allows using either PCoA or tSNE;
    <li>Plots the resulting embeddings.
 </ul>
 Why should you use pear_ebi? Because it's <font color='green'><b>simple</b><font color='black'>, <font color='dark orange'><b>fast</b><font color='black'>, and <font color='purple'><b>produces nice graphs</b></font>!

### Load trees ###
Pear has two kind of structures for your trees:<ol>
    <li><font color='blue'>tree_set</font>;<li><font color='dark pink'>set_collection</font>.
</ol>
You define a <font color='blue'>tree_set</font> with a set of trees coming from a single file, whereas a <font color='dark pink'>set_collection</font> is composed of trees coming from multiple files, divided into groups depending on the file of origin. In practice, computationally and conceptually, a <font color='dark pink'>set_collection</font> is a set of multiple <font color='blue'>tree_set</font>.
<br>We'll make it clear exploring how we can load trees on pear with a few examples.


```python
# load single set of trees into a tree_set #
!pear_ebi beast_trees/beast_long.trees
```

Although you may be perplexed about the actual practical difference between these structures, we suggest you keep these questions for the next chapters and bear with us to explore some more funky ways of loading trees onto pear.
<br>In fact, you can avoid boring repetitions of the path of your files and simply indicate the directory!

If you are a regex wizard you can probably select any set of similarly-named files in this way. Me? I generally ask GPT to write the magic formula. <b>NB:</b> you can also use a combination of `--dir`, `--pattern`, and normal file definition if one or more files come from other directories.


```python
!pear_ebi beast_trees/beast_long.trees --dir beast_trees --pattern "*run[1,2]*"

### Compute Distances ###
You can compute the distance matrix using different methods. Each method has a specific purpose, which is outlined in the associated paper. However, in general, the Robison Foulds distance metric is an admittedly good choice. Additionally, pear_ebi computes this metric using the hashrf algorithm, which is the fastest way of computing such metric to date. You can indicate any method available using the `-m`, or `--method`, flag. When a metric/method is indicated, pear will use it to compute the distance matrix <b>even if a distance matrix is given</b>, and it <b>will overscribe any previous matrix saved at a file with the same standard format</b> (realistically, this happens only if the matrix was produced using pear during an interactive or advanced session - see the interactive sessions chapter).

If you run the exaples above you will notice the difference between the time efficiency of hashrf and any other algorithm. Please note the astonishing performance of that algorithm, especially considering the sensible difference in the number of trees analyzed!

Given that one may want to analyze the distance matrix in multiple ways,
possibly desiring to skip the hefty distance-computation step, we introduced the
convenient `-d` flag that allows specifying a previosuly computed distance matrix.
<b>Please note that</b> the order of the trees in the distance matrix is preserved and
thus one must be consistent with the input specification when reusing a distance matrix.
Should you disregard this suggestion, we suggest you also disregard your downstream analyses
(and perhaps everything else as well).

Please note the difference in the input "Distance matrix" status.

### Embed distances ###
Here we show the easy way of embedding the distances and produce nice plots! First of all, one may choose any number of dimensions $M \leq N$; where $N$ is the number of trees and $M$ the chosen dimensionality of the embedded space. Note that, should $M$ be $\lt 3$, pear will produce only one 2D plot. Whereas, should $M$ be $\geq 3$ pear will produce a 2D and a 3D plot. Please note that we are currently unable to produce human-friendly representations for $\gt 3$D data... In any case, whichever dimension $M$ may be chosen, an $M$-dimensional embedding shall be produced and then saved on the machine.

# compute triplet distances, embed in 2D using pcoa #

<i>Pro tip</i>: since in order to compute an embedded space we need the distance matrix first, pear will automatically compute the distances with `hashrf_RF` when no method is indicated (and no precomputed distance matrix is specified)

## <font color='blue'>tree_set</font> vs <font color='dark pink'>set_collection</font> ##
Pear has two kind of structures for your trees:<ol>
    <li><font color='blue'>tree_set</font>;<li><font color='dark pink'>set_collection</font>.
</ol>
<font color='blue'>tree_set</font> allows for analyzing a single set of trees.
<font color='dark pink'>set_collection</font> allows for analyzing multiple set of trees and the divergences between them.
In our interactive plots, <font color='dark pink'>set_collection</font> generates different sets of points that are colored
according to the file of origin. This could be useful, for instance, if one performs multiple runs of a phylogenetic-tree estimating algorithm and wants to assess the robustness/consistency of that method.
<br>The distances computation is overall the same as a square distance matrix is generated, encompassing the whole collection of trees.

****

## Interactive Sessions ##
All the above, but staying in the loop!
<br>You can add set of trees iteratively and compute distances/embeddings as many times as you want to.

the flags `--meta` and `--config` introduce another layer of flexibility into our analyses.
